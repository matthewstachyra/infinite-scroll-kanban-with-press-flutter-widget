# infinite scroll kanban widget

### This widget is incorporates a kanban uptop that has infinite scroll (it will cycle through the provided elements in both directions). Each element is pressable and will update the body of the app with that element. Accordingly, updates to the body of the app update the kanban position too. You can use either to find the element you want. This intended to provide 2 different ways (fast and slow) to scroll through content, such as in a social media app.
